Class: CSE 130 | programming in C and C++
Language: C
Program discription: 
Tell me a story.

In this century, and moment, of mania,
Tell me a story.

Make it a story of great distances, and starlight.

The name of the story will be Time,
But you must not pronounce its name.

Tell me a story of deep delight.

--Robert Penn Warren

NOTES: This program should tell you a story. I hope it's okay I took the liberty of having some fun with it.
