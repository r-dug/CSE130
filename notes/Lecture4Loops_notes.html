    <h1>Lecture4Loops - Computer Science C/C++ Programming</h1>
    <h2>Looping Constructs in C and C++</h2>
    
    <p>Loops are fundamental constructs in programming that allow for repetitive execution of a block of code. They are especially useful when paired with certain operators.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>The while Loop</h3>
        <p>The <code>while</code> loop continues to execute a block of code as long as the condition remains true.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            <code>
            int i = 1;<br>
            while (i &lt;= 10) {<br>
                printf("%d ", i);<br>
                i++;<br>
            }
            </code>
        </p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>The for Loop</h3>
        <p>The <code>for</code> loop allows for initialization, condition checking, and incrementation in one line, making it compact for iterations.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            <code>
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {<br>
                printf("%d ", i);<br>
            }
            </code>
        </p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>The do-while Loop</h3>
        <p>The <code>do-while</code> loop guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once before the condition is checked.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            <code>
            int i = 1;<br>
            do {<br>
                printf("%d ", i);<br>
                i++;<br>
            } while (i &lt;= 10);
            </code>
        </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Break and Continue Statements</h3>
        <p><code>break</code> exits the loop immediately, while <code>continue</code> skips the rest of the loop and starts the next iteration.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Nested Loops</h3>
        <p>Nested loops are loops inside another loop. They are often used for multi-dimensional data structures.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Converting for loop to while loop</h3>
        <p>You can often convert a <code>for</code> loop into a <code>while</code> loop, although the <code>for</code> loop syntax is generally preferred for clarity when iterating a known number of times.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Infinite Loops</h3>
        <p>Infinite loops run indefinitely because their condition is always true and they lack an exit mechanism. Use with caution.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            <code>while (1) { /* code */ }</code>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Running Sum</h3>
        <p>Keeping a running sum involves incrementally adding numbers to a total.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong><br>
            <code>
            int sum = 0;<br>
            for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {<br>
                sum += i;<br>
            }<br>
            printf("Sum = %d", sum);
            </code>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>System Calls</h3>
        <p>System calls such as <code>printf()</code> can be used within loops for output.</p>
